gmodmenu
========

A different version of the gmod menu made by MeepDarknessMeep
	This is still very early in it's development life and might have a few errors
	
	If you find an error please report it! It will never get fixed if you don't!

	- Single player is still broken
	- Multiplayer menu is revamped (some people say it looks a lot like steam's old one).
	- Options is included
	- Quit button
	- Have not added disconnect button yet! It is easy to add and when I get another time of boredness I will probably add it
	
Suggestion? 
	Make a pull request!
